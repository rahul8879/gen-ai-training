    "### Jupyter Notebook Task: Exploring Iris Flower Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task Description:\n",
    "You have been provided with the famous Iris flower dataset, which includes the sepal and petal measurements of three different species of Iris flowers. Your task is to perform exploratory data analysis and build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements. Follow the instructions below to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**\n",
    "   - Load the Iris dataset and explore its structure, including the features, target variable, and any missing values.\n",
    "   - Visualize the data using appropriate plots to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Standardize the features to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the KNN classifier.\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier:**\n",
    "   - Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the Iris flower species based on their measurements.\n",
    "   - Experiment with different values of K and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conclusion and Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - Summarize the findings from the exploratory data analysis and the KNN classification.\n",
    "   - Interpret the results and discuss the relevance of the model's performance in predicting the species of Iris flowers accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grader Function:\n",
    "Use the following function to grade the task submission:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def grader(predicted_labels, true_labels):\n",
    "    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n",
    "    accuracy = accuracy_score(true_labels, predicted_labels)\n",
    "    if accuracy >= 0.9:\n",
    "        return \"Excellent work! You have demonstrated a strong understanding of the dataset and the KNN algorithm.\"\n",
    "    elif accuracy >= 0.8:\n",
    "        return \"Good job! Your analysis and model performance are commendable, but there is room for improvement.\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"Keep practicing! Try revisiting the data preprocessing and model tuning steps to enhance your results.\"\n"
